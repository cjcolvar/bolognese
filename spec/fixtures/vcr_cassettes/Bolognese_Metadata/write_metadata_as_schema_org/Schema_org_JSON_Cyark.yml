        Heritage 3D","description":"As 3D and reality capture strategies for heritage
        documentation become more widespread and available, there has emerged a growing
        need to assist with guiding and facilitating accessibility to data, while
        maintaining scientific rigor, cultural and ethical sensitivity, discoverability,
        and archival standards. In response to these areas of need, The Open Heritage
        3D Alliance (OHA) has developed as an advisory group governing the Open Heritage
        3D initiative. This collaborative advisory group are among some of the earliest
        adopters of 3D heritage documentation technologies, and offer first-hand guidance
        for best practices in data management, sharing, and dissemination approaches
        for 3D cultural heritage projects.\n\nThe founding members of the OHA, consist
        of experts and organizational leaders from CyArk, Historic Environment Scotland,
        and the University of South Florida Libraries, who together have significant
        repositories of legacy and on-going 3D research and documentation projects.
        These groups offer unique insight into not only the best practices for 3D
        data capture and sharing, but also have come together around concerns dealing
        with standards, formats, approach, ethics, and archive commitment. Together,
        the OHA has begun the journey to provide open access to cultural heritage
        3D data, while maintaining integrity, security, and standards relating to
        discoverable dissemination. Together, the OHA will work to provide democratized
        access to primary heritage 3D data submitted from donors and organizations,
        and will help to facilitate an operation platform, archive, and organization
        of resources into the future","language":["en"],"clientType":"repository","domains":"*","re3data":null,"opendoar":null,"issn":{},"url":"https://openheritage3d.org/","created":"2019-03-26T16:21:19.000Z","updated":"2020-04-27T15:30:01.000Z","isActive":true,"hasPassword":true},"relationships":{"provider":{"data":{"id":"cyark","type":"providers"}},"prefixes":{"data":[{"id":"10.26301","type":"prefixes"}]}}}]}'
